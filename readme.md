DaBes Engine
============

_"I'm da besssss"_

What is done:
* Base layer of SDL/OpenGL
* Framework for decoupled graphics, physics, input, and audio engines
* Build for desktop (with SDL) or iOS
* Graphics engine:
    * Can load shaders and draw with them
    * Can load SDL surfaces into OpenGL textures
    * Camera tracking
    * Can render TMX tile maps
    * Parallax layers
* Physics engine:
    * Can use Chipmunk because writing a Physics engine is hard
* Audio engine:
    * Can play music and control the volume of it
* Scripting engine:
    * Can configure scenes with Lua scripts

What is not yet done:
* Graphics engine:
    * Sprite animations
    * Keyframe animations
* Audio engine:
    * OGG support
    * Sound effects
* Scripting engine:
    * Entity control scripts
    * Interaction scripts
    * Game state management
* Debug tools:
    * Entity inspector

Bugs:
* Debug text currently dead
* Tile maps should be disposed of more thoroughly (destroy is leaking)
* Parallax zoom is sliiiightly weird

Code Gripes:
* Too many cpp directives, not enough platform specific modules

```
# Ya gonna need dis stuf!
brew install --HEAD sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf sdl_mixer libogg libvorbis

make game
./game
```

If you are trying to build the XCode project, you need to build the submodule
```
make submodules
```
